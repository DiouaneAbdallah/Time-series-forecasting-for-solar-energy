Nowadays, the world is in need for more renewable energy ☀️ to maintain the development in every domain.
The renewable energy with the biggest share in many countries is the solar energy harvested using photovoltaic
installations all over the world. But the use of these installations use a tremendous amount of resources every
time. So in this project we opted to use a deep learning approach based on past energy production to limit the
use of these installations by predicting the amount of energy they produce at certain times, thus minimizing
their the working time ⏲️.

this project is made with ❤️, in collab with [El hachemy Said](https://www.linkedin.com/in/said-el-hachemy).
